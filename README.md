# AncientGreek This is a project to devise a functional keymap for Ancient Greek using an AnnePro 2 keyboard. The keymap used is taken from https://help.keyman.com/keyboard/greekclassical/1.2/greekclassical
Current steps are:
1: Make the keymap functional
2: Make Layer 1 (FN1) accessible by tapping the tab key twice from base layer (layer 0)
3: Make Layer 2 (FN2) accessible by tapping the tab key twice from Layer 1
4: Make base layer (layer 0) accessible by tapping the tab key twice from Layer 2
5: Make the 'Settings' Layer (FN3) accessible by holding shift and tapping tab twice from the base layer (and repeating to return to the base layer)
6: Have different coloured background LEDs for each layer (e.g. base white, FN1 blue, FN2 green, FN3 red)
7: In layers FN2 and FN3, have the usable keys in those layers highlighted in a different colour (e.g. if FN2 is background green, the usable keys will be haloed yellow)
